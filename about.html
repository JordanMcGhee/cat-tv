   <h1>What is CAT</h1>
   <p>Columbia Access Television is an independent Community Media Center that empowers our community members and local nonprofits to:</p>

<p>-SHARE their diverse voices with Columbia</p>
<p>-LEARN new and innovative media skills</p>
<p>-USE high-tech video equipment and other media technology</p>

   <h1>History of CAT</h1>
   <p>Formed in 2004, CAT operates the public access TV channel for the City of Columbia. Programming on CAT-TV channel 85 is 81% locally produced, including Locals-Only Primetime. Our entire archive of local shows (1450+) is available to watch On Demand and Podcast.</p>
   <p>In 2013, 2012 and 2010, CAT received national awards for Overall Excellence in Public Access (budget under $300,000) at the Hometown Video Awards.  The awards are coordinated by the Alliance for Community Media (ACM). Founded in 1976, the ACM represents more than 3,000 public, educational and government (PEG) access organizations and community media centers throughout the United States.</p>
 <h1>What is public access & Why is it important</h1>
 <p>In exchange for their use of public property, cable television providers are required to fund and broadcast PEG access channels (Public, Education, Government).</p>
 <p>Public access makes it possible for anyone in the community to have the equipment and training necessary to make television programs.</p>
 <p>Public access is a dedicated media outlet for Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Expression, without interference from government or private interests.</p>
